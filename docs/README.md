# Documentation

This repo includes two documentation tracks intended to be synced into GitBook as separate Spaces:

- `docs/toc-handbook/` — TOC/Substitute-facing handbook (quick, action-oriented)
- `docs/admin-guide/` — Teacher/Admin guide (configuration, maintenance, troubleshooting)

## Recommended GitBook setup

Create two GitBook Spaces and sync each folder to its corresponding Space.

## Conventions

- Keep TOC content short and procedural.
- Keep admin content explicit and step-by-step.
- Prefer lists and checklists over long prose.
- Match the RCS DayPlan Style Guide section order and terminology.
